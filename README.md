# Predicting-Coronavirus-Cases-with-ProphetPredicting-Coronavirus-Cases-with-Prophet

A novel human corona virus was originated from China in December 2019, causing a severe potentially fatal respiratory syndrome (COVID-19). The symptoms of COVID-19 may or may not be visual in infected individual hence spread rate can be faster as individual himself not aware of infection [1]. World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic on 3oth January 2020 due to its faster spread [2]. Despite of the continuous efforts, the virus has managed to spread in most of the territories in the world; WHO has announced COVID-19 as Pandemic [3]. Countries throughout the world working cooperatively and openly with one another and coming together as an united front in regards of efforts to bring this situation under control using available Information, Communication and Technologies (ICT).

Predictive analytics is specialized branch of data analytics for making better predictions using past data and using analysis techniques which includes statistical and learning methods. Discovery of patterns in input data and anticipating what is likely to happen is the man objective of predictive analytics. Statistical analysis, predictive modelling and machine learning are three main pillars of predictive analytics. The main capabilities of predictive analytics are statistical analysis, predictive modelling, linear regression and logistic model. Selection of appropriate predictive model and algorithm decide how efficiently we can make the better insights and useful decisions. Use case like hospital interested in prediction of number of patients likely to be admitted in intensive care unit in next seven days and prediction of fraud transaction for online banking provider might require different predictive analytics model than for predicting defaulter applicant for loan provider and predicting number of COVID-19 infected patient in next 10 days. Selection of appropriate predictive model is based on what predictive question would you like to address and how optimization can be carried out using predictive algorithms.
